 :change post comment rendering to just puuting the response comment on state

 updating vote count by mapping over current state finding which comment id matches the returned comment then replacing that comment with the new one 
 and then setting state with that new array

 look at redirection in notes and aim for implementation of it

 make comments load based off timestamp



 list of improvements

 hey david i marked your ncnews overall alot of your functions where implemented quite well just providing you with some feedback and improvements for next time round!
general-overall unfinished and maybe functional code without much flourish?

UX:
- just text so no user experience

Code:
DEALT WITH-Could wrap navigation links in nav tag  
DEALT WITH -Should make articles by topic a reusable component to handle all articles or articles by topic: both components do the exact same thing (use appropriate lifecycle methods) => actually your articles seems to look like its handling this so why the need for the separate topic component 
DEALT WITH ComponentDidMount doesn’t have to be async because you call another function which does the async stuff for you
-You don’t need to declare a variable to update with async await you can just set it equal to the await ….
-Issues with using let in wrong contexts
-Would do to have an article card component that you render on mapping over articles
-Get rid of console.logs
-Use proptypes 
-In your vote function you set state twice: what are you trying to do?
-Don’t need to make a copy of each comment immutably if you aren’t mutating them
-Don’t need to spread state either  (postcomment) it will only update the keys that you tell it to
-Need a readme
