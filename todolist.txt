 :change post comment rendering to just puuting the response comment on state

 updating vote count by mapping over current state finding which comment id matches the returned comment then replacing that comment with the new one 
 and then setting state with that new array

 look at redirection in notes and aim for implementation of it

 make comments load based off timestamp
